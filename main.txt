# Set up virtual env --> python -m venv env (creates target dir/virtual env)
# activate venv to use --> env/Scripts/Activate.ps1 OR .\env\Scripts\activate
	The venv needs to be activated in every new terminal window to use it (set up shell to use isolated env)
# uvicorn main:app --reload (run the server/app) [where main is the file name and app is the FastAPI instance]
	--port 8000 (to specify port) [default is 8000]
	--reload (to auto-reload server on code changes)

# Decorators (Python) are used to modify the behavior of functions, classes.
--> They work by wrapping the function, modify with added logic before/after function execution and return the modified function.
# FastApi uses built-in decorators to simplify defining the routes/endpoints and handling functionality (Depends dependency injection, auth, etc.)

#Pydantic is dependency of, and gets installed with FastAPI
# FastAPI uses Pydantic for data validation (typing), and serialization (convert data structure/obj into format it can be stored or transmitted - also known as deflating, marshalling). This also auto applies in the generated documentation where it will show expected data types and structure + give warnings when entering wrong data types to test with
	eg. using pydantic and specifying id: int, FastAPI will automatically convert the id from str (in pathname param) to an integer else returns helpful error message to client.
	-In Pydantic, the term "validation" refers to the process of instantiating a model (or other type) that adheres to specified types and constraints. Pydantic guarantees the types and constraints of the output, not the input data. This distinction becomes apparent when considering that Pydantic's ValidationError is raised when data cannot be successfully parsed into a model instance.
	-can include the copying and coercion of data. This can involve copying arguments passed to the constructor in order to perform coercion to a new type without mutating the original input data.

# Order of Routes --> eg. use static routes first, then dynamic routes, then catch-all routes

# Use Query() from FastAPI to add extra validation for query params + add metadata (eg. description)
	# !!remove | None and add ... to make it required (also has no default value now - you can set default instead)
    # !!use list[str] to specify that it should be a list of strings i.e multiple query params
	# setting include_in_schema=False will exclude the param from the generated OpenAPI schema (docs)
# Use Path() from FastAPI to add extra validation for path params + add metadata (eg. description)
# Use Body() from FastApi to add another key in the body - i.e add multiple body params to path operation function even though request can only have a single body. FastAPI + pydantic will handle and validate 
# Field() is imported from pydantic NOT fastapi BUT used in exactly the same way (has all the same params)
	used for BODY PARAMS (sent in req body) to declare extra validations and metadata for model attributes
	eg. use item: Item = Body(..., embed=True) to embed item as the key with the dict being the value in the body
	--> 'item' : {} vs just {} in the body
# Declare headers,cookies with Header(), Cookie() fastapi, using the same common pattern as Query and Path.
## note for Headers() by default converts param names from _ to - to match HTTP headers 
### *!NOTE: Cannot declare a non-defualt/required path param after a default path param (FastAPI will throw an error)
	using * as first argument as workaround for this since it will be treated as a required path param
*You can declare extra information in Field, Query, Body, etc. And it will be included in the generated JSON Schema.

OTHER DATA TYPES in Pydantic Model declaration eg. UUID, datetime, Decimal, etc. can be used in Pydantic models and FastAPI will automatically convert them to the correct type (need to import from libraries)


# EXTRA MODELS
# You can declare a response_model to be eg. Union[model1, model2] to return either model1 or model2 using Union from typing

# HANDLING ERRORS - using HTTPException from FastAPI
## Use to notify an error to a client --> eg. raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
## HTTPException is a normal Python exception with additional data relevant for APIs (hence 'raise' instead of return) + will terminate/won't run the rest of the request handler code 
## HTTPException can be passed with any value (passed as arg in function def) that can be converted to JSON as param (eg. list, dict, etc.). Conversion handled automatically by FastAPI
## able to add custom headers, Use custom exception handlers (need to define a custom exception handler function [a Pydantic class] in the app using the exception_handler decorator), 
## Override default FastAPI Exception handlersRequestValidationError (also needs @app.exception_handler(RequestValidationError) function to be defined)
	RequestValidationError contains .error and .body it received with the invalid data, which can be used for debug/dev
eg. @app.exception_handler(RequestValidationError)
async def validation_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError):
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=status.HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY,
        content=jsonable_encoder({"detail": exc.errors(), "body": exc.body}),
    )

# model_copy() Pydantic function to create copy of existing model, or you can use 
.model_dump(exclude_unset=True) to exclude unset values from the model (i.e. fields with default values won't be included in output)

# DEPENDENCIES - FastAPI dependency injection system
- dependency injection is a technique in which an object receives other objects that it depends on (dependencies) rather than creating them itself. FastAPI uses this to manage dependencies in request handlers
Dependency must be 'callable' i.e. anything in Python that can be called like a function --> functions, Classes (since you have to call to instantiate/create an instance by calling class)
use = Depends(dependency_name) - only accepts a single arg so you can create eg.
## Classes as Dependencies - (since they are callable)
## Sub-Dependencies --> able to nest dependencies (eg. use a dependency inside another dependency) by using the dependency as a parameter in the function that defines the sub-dependency. Consider since dependency only accepts a single dependable
## FastAPI will know that it has to solve the sub-dependency first before solving the main dependency
ADVANTAGE OF USING DEPENDENCIES:
Code reusability (eg. common params), Separation of concerns/tasks (dependency to handle db connection, auth etc), Auto Dependency Resolution by fast API (only called once per request--> simplify speed up code?), Auto request Validation if dependency has params.
